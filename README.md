# Awin PHP

![CI](https://github.com/encreinformatique/awin-php/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This is a fork from [yuzu-co/awin-php](https://github.com/yuzu-co/awin-php)
While the original codebase supported PHP 5.6, I decided to drop it and PHP 7.0 to 7.1.
They ended their life and I do not use them either.

For those versions of PHP, please refer to the original codebase.

The name into the composer has now changed to `encreinformatique/awin-php`.
